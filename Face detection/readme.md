Steps to perform:
I am providing the code in both .py and .ipynb format.

1. run the face_detection.py file.
  This face_detection code will record your face and store the images in dataset folder...
  
 2. Now we have to train model on these face datsset, so we will run th training.py code,
  Which will train the model on dataset...
  
  3. Now it's time to recognize the face.
    We will run the face_recognition.py code.
    In the face detection code we can store multiple faces(I used upto five faces) or label them according to user id.
    
  4. result:
